This is the HTML and CSS code I designed for me to display a blog about Liverpool transfers and their ambitions going into next season as a mini project. I had no experience with HTML and only needed one day to get a grasp of it which shows I am a very fast learner and also love problem solving as there were a few sticking points that I had to solve in the code to make it work like for example,  I had a hard time making the images display even though I was copying the link of the image onto the code it still would not display but after researching I found out that  I had to create a new file called images then drag the images I wanted into the new file then as soon as I write imagesr/ the link for the image appears making it easier.
