        <h2>Transfers</h2>
        <p>
            After winning the Premier League in the 2024/25 season, Liverpool wasted no time strengthening their squad.
            Several new signings have arrived to address key areas, including energetic full-backs to provide attacking
            width,
            and a highly creative midfielder to unlock deep-lying defenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            These players are expected to immediately challenge for starting roles and bring fresh dynamism to the team.
            The
            transfer strategy clearly reflects a desire not just to defend their title but to improve squad depth and
            versatility for the challenges ahead.

        <h2>Tactics</h2>
        <p>
            Under Arne Slot, Liverpool are shifting toward a more fluid 4-2-3-1 formation, focusing on structured
            pressing and
            controlled possession. The new full-backs will allow the team to maintain width and press higher up the
            pitch,
            while the central attacking midfielder is set to be the creative hub linking play between midfield and
            attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            With players comfortable on the ball and tactically intelligent, Liverpool aim to dominate possession and
            apply
            constant pressure in the final third. This evolution adds layers to their aggressive, fast-paced style
            inherited
            from the Klopp era.

        <h2>Ambitions</h2>
        <p>
            Fresh off a historic league title, Liverpool enter the 2025/26 campaign with confidence and high
            expectations.
            The club is targeting another Premier League win, a deep Champions League run, and domestic cup success.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a rejuvenated squad and clear tactical vision, Liverpool are not just contenders—they’re aiming to
            dominate
            on all fronts. The summer signings reflect a long-term vision to compete at the highest level and sustain
            success
            across multiple competitions.
